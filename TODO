Alpha 2 (i.e., embarrasing stuff)
---------------------------------

* compiler, driver

  - remove interpreter cruft

  - visitor?

  - Pyrize

  - get rid of ad-hoc stuff

  - libs

    + factor-out C bridge

* garbage collector

* Spike programs must be easier to debug!

  - possible/difficult to make 'gdb' usable?

* FFI needs help

  - type checking, more types

  - related: name mangling
  
  - CMethod?

* PIC code

  - must sacrifice a register

  - no relocations in text!

* Unresolved/Unfinished/Absent
  
  - compiled method hashtables, interning
  
    + do we really need Symbol?
  
  - unordered keyword expressions
  
  - require 'self' in method declarators
  
  - abandon function-style methods?
  
  - method return should default to 'self'
  
    + allow stmt-list-expr ?


Refactoring
-----------

* IL ("yip"?)

  - Reasons to have a printable/parsable representation:

    + avoids polluting high-level language with stuff only needed in
      Integer, etc.

    + Assembly language is better adapted to primitive operations.
      E.g., 'add' could take a third argument: a label that is
      branched to when the primitive fails.

  - enables more backends:  PowerPC, x86-64, ARM


Features
--------

* compound literals

  - vital that there be a data format similar to plist/JSON

* switch

  - 'pass' ?

* visit

  - Nested switches in compiler highlights need for this.

  - I don't care about purity, but message/selector switch is a
    "cleaner" alternative.

* unless (from Perl)

  - Then why not Pascal's "do [repeat] ... until (cond)"?  ...and
    simply "until (cond) ..."?  In general, I might remember things I
    like about Pascal by doing a Pascal plug-in grammar... and I
    should then steal those things.

* just 'do' (for 'break')

* break/continue in blocks

  - indiscriminate 'break' now seems easy, but 'continue' still problematic
  
    + break similar to method unwind & return:  unwind and branch
    + continue is block return?
    + which ones are loops?

  - nested blocks: can unwind to BlockContext?

* namespaces

  - Simple except for 'use' problem.


Ideas
-----

* lightweight blocks

  - semi-statically alloca()te BlockContext objects on method entry

    + since 'closure' is now needed for true closures, this should have little
      impact

    + probably only affects code which tries to create blocks in a loop


Things to steal from Python
---------------------------

* string literal delimiters

* tuple (un)packing

  - hopefully can be accomplished with sub-grammars

    + comma/assign has different relative precedence according to context

  - perhaps assignment could be excluded in some contexts
  
    + "if (a = b)" not just warning, but a syntax error

* slices

* 'assert' keyword

* and, or

* else clause on loops

* in ? is ?

* comprehensions ?

  - competes with blocks


Python features that must be answered
-------------------------------------

* exceptions

* multiple inheritance

  - a radical solution:  eliminate 'super'

    + How would a cooperative method (e.g., init) be written?

  - less radical:  method-only ABCs (no vars, no super)
